    /* ZORA: CreateFileMapping is the windows.h function to create a virtual file.This method returns a HANDLE object which is like a pointer to a file.If the function fails, the HANDLE will be a nullptr.This is set by the first parameter.Access type is set by the 3rd parameter.

    The size of the memory block to be allocated is recorded in the 4th and 5th parameters, and the Microsoft documentation explains: "If this parameter (5th) and dwMaximumSizeHigh (4th) are 0, the maximum size of the file mapping object is equal to the current size of the file that hFile (the HANDLE) identifies."

    Currently the named shared memory is configured to share memory of a size equal to a user-defined struct called MyData, which is the size of its 5 member variables.

    Memory is allocated at the point when CreateFileMapping is executed so there is no need to use the 'new' keyword to instantiate anything / allocate memory.
